## Causality Workshop 2018 

We are looking forwart to our first **Causality Workshop 14th of December 2018.** 

The event will take place at **University of ZÃ¼rich, KO2-F-156** (between UZH main building and Mensa)  and is organised by Beate Sick and Gilles Kratzer.

We have some [confirmed input talks](talks.md) and in addition we
**call for <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/152oGwHph-zKIKvuVZOR4Ws36xfrmyrhaU6WT8BvJNNM/edit?usp=sharing">contributions</a>** - short talks or posters where you describe your ideas on causal inference or projects in which you incorporate, or would like to incorporate, causal inference approaches. This is an introductory workshop - we expect no method development contributions (but also these are welcome), but rather posters or talks on the application of causal modeling or on projects with causal research questions on which we can discuss how causal methods could be applied. In general all topics dealing with aspects of causal modeling are welcome (e.g. discussing methods suggested by Pearl or other researchers in the causality field).

### Focus

The focus of the workshop is on sharing ideas and experience on how to approach causal research questions when working with observational data. We want discuss how to incorporate causal models in our projects. We do not assume familiarity with the theory of causal models but will give some [input talks](talks.md). We like to have **active participation** and encourage contributions (short talks or posters), discussions, and all kind of questions. There will be sessions with talks and also a time for short talks, discussion or posters during extended coffee breaks. 

### Subscription
Everybody who is interested in causality is welcome to participate. Note that the number of participants is limited to 30 persons (first come first serve) and attendees with active presentation will be given preference.  The workshop is free (no fees).
