## Causality Workshop 2018 

We are looking forwart to our first **Causality Workshop 14th of December 2018.** 

The event will take place at <a href="https://www.plaene.uzh.ch/KO2">**University of ZÃ¼rich, KO2-F-156**</a> (next to UZH main building and Mensa)  and is jointly organised by Beate Sick (Department of Biostatistics UZH) and Gilles Kratzer (Applied Statstics group UZH).

### Focus

The focus of the workshop is on sharing ideas and experience on how to approach intervention planning or causal research questions when working with observational data. We want discuss how to incorporate causal models in our projects. We do not assume familiarity with the theory of causal models but will give some [input talks](talks.md). We like to have **active participation** and encourage contributions (short talks), discussions, and all kind of questions.  

### Subscription
Everybody who is interested in causality is welcome to participate. Note that the number of participants is limited to 30 persons (first come first serve) and attendees with active presentation will be given preference.  The workshop is free (no fees) - we thank Reinhard Furrer, head of the Applied Statistics group at UZH, for sponsoring the event.
