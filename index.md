<h3>Mode of the DL journal and discussion club</h3>

<ul>
	<li/> We want to meet ~ every 2 or 3 weeks to discuss a DL publication or other DL topics 
  <li/> We do not envision a talk with slides (that is <a href="https://tensorchiefs.github.io/bbs/">bbs</a>) but want a discussion between all participants which requires that we all read (roughly) through the material before the meeting
	<li/> One person suggests the topic and leads the session and reads the paper more carefully but also does not need to be an expert! 
	   <li/>The discussion leader provides links to the material/article one week before the meeting 
  <li/>Everybody who wants to participate must also once suggest a topic and lead the discussion (or do a <a href="https://tensorchiefs.github.io/bbs/">bbs</a>)  - please put your name on the list below:

</ul>

Ideally, the topics is connected to DL and are not too complicated, so that we all can manage to read through the suggested material (otherwise it suites better for a <a href="https://tensorchiefs.github.io/bbs/">bbs</a> which is also good).

Feel free to extent the list by dates or change the dates and put-in your name with “tba” topics and decide spontanously on the topic. Ideally, the discussion leader sends out an e-mail ~1 week before the meeting (e-mails are in the list above) and organizes a room, but you can also ask me to do that for you. 
 
It is clear that not all can make it every time but the event lives from our active participation. In case of any question please feel free to contact me (sick@zhaw.ch).
