## The book of Why 
**Beate Sick (UZH)**

Abstract:
This talk discusses parts of the “The book of Why” by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie. 
he book was discussed in the New York Times 
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/business/dealbook/review-the-book-of-why-examines-the-science-of-cause-and-effect.html 
and on ML Reddit: http://www.inference.vc/untitled/ and also in a science podcast (last third): 
http://www.sciencemag.org/podcast/science-and-nature-get-their-social-science-studies-replicated-or-not-mechanisms-behind
The reading of the book inspired me a lot and brought me to reflect on typical pitfalls and the limitations of statistics 
and machine learning and the great potentials of incorporating causal graphical using the language of Bayesian Networks. 
I will use examples from the book to point out that intervention planning and predicting the impact size of interventions 
requires the usage of causal models.
