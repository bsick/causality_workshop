# Effects of client-counselor matching on counseling and motivating unemployed clients

**Julia Casutt**

In my contribution, I want to investigate the impact of client-counsellor matching in the framework 
of counselling unemployed people at the local unemployment agencies in Switzerland 
(Regionale Arbeitsvermittlungszentren RAV). I'm interested in whether certain matching constellations 
(e.g. female counsellors/female clients, client and counsellor are in the same age-group etc.) affect the 
job search outcomes and reduce the duration of unemployment. My database consists of about 60000 unemployment 
cases from 2016, where I have information on socio-economic characteristics and other variables for both 
counsellor and client as well as information on outcome and duration of the job search. 
For my research I want to apply causal inference methods in order to derive well-founded recommendations for my work.
